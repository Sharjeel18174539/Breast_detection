# Breast_detection
To detect whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on features like cell size, shape, and texture using machine learning models.

K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm 
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm generally used for classification but can 
also be used for regression tasks. It works by finding the "k" closest data points (neighbors) to a given input 
and makesa predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression).  

Decision Tree 
A decision tree is a graphical representation of different options for solving a problem and show how different 
factors are related. It has a hierarchical tree structure starts with one main question at the top called a node 
which further branches out into different possible outcomes 

Random Forest 
Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that uses many decision trees to make better predictions. Each 
tree looks at different random parts of the data and their results are combined by voting for classification or 
averaging for regression. This helps in improving accuracy and reducing errors. 

Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and 
regression tasks. It tries to find the best boundary known as hyperplane that separates different classes in 
the data. It is useful when you want to do binary classification like spam vs. not spam or cat vs. dog. 
The main goal of SVM is to maximize the margin between the two classes. The larger the margin the better 
the model performs on new and unseen data.
